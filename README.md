## DFTF immune expression profiling

This repo consists ofwork to analyse some targeted RNA-seq data of tassie devils with and without 
devil facial tumor disease (DFTD).
The goal is determine whether DFTD causes changes to the expression of immune related genes.

The main comparisons are:

-Wild and Captive devils

-Healthy and DFTD infected devils

-DFT1 and DFT2 devils

I have their sex/age/seasons categories there as well if we decide to go with more detail analysis in
the future, but I think just stick with these three for now.

Some devils are a part of the Captive control and Wild control groups .

There are a couple samples that won't go into the analysis that I made note of. Meliza and Simba.
